        <h2>About the Classes</h2>
        <p>
          At Zuca Tuga, Portuguese classes are created with care, creativity, and attention to your needs. 
          We believe that learning a new language should be an engaging, meaningful, and real-life connected experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work with a communicative and task-based approach, which means you learn to express yourself in Portuguese while developing skills for real-life situations: 
          chatting in everyday life, traveling, studying, working, or simply immersing yourself in the culture. 
          Classes are online, live, and personalized according to your level (A1 to C2), learning style, and goals â€” whether professional, academic, or simply for pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our methodology combines a focus on conversation, multisensory phonetics, grammar in context, 
          spontaneous oral and written production, and teaching vocabulary and idiomatic expressions in real situations. 
          All of this is integrated with the use of games, music, literature, art, and cultural elements from Brazil and Portugal â€” 
          making each class dynamic, engaging, and inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than just teaching Portuguese, we want you to feel welcomed, confident, and motivated to explore the language with freedom and curiosity. 
          Here, your pace is respected, and your story matters.
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! Iâ€™m Simone, the creator of Zuca Tuga â€” a space dedicated to the warm and creative teaching of Portuguese for foreigners. 
          Iâ€™m Brazilian, I live in Portugal, and I deeply believe in the power of languages to bring people, cultures, and stories together.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic background has always been focused on language as an expression of identity, culture, and creativity â€” and it was precisely this passion that led me to teaching Portuguese as an additional language. 
          I hold a degree in Languages â€“ UNESA, a Specialization in Literature Teaching â€“ UFRN, 
          a Specialization in Applied Linguistics for Language Teaching â€“ UFMS, and 
          a Specialization in Teaching Portuguese to Foreigners â€“ PUCRJ. 
          Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Teaching Portuguese as a Foreign Language at the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, NOVA University of Lisbon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I have built a solid career as a teacher, gathering experience with students from different nationalities, profiles, and contexts. 
          I believe that learning a new language goes far beyond grammar: it is an encounter with other ways of living, thinking, and feeling. 
          That is what drives me as an educator.
        </p>
        <p>
          I value each lesson as a genuine opportunity for exchange. 
          They are unique moments, full of listening, discovery, and affection â€” moments where I not only teach but also learn from every student. 
          This interaction is, for me, what gives meaning to my work and fuels my desire to continue on this path.
        </p>
